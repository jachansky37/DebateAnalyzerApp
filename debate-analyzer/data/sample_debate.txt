I'm not sure that's true. Can you prove it? I think it's obvious!

I believe that implementing a universal basic income would reduce poverty and simplify welfare programs.

But wouldn’t that just encourage people not to work? If everyone gets money for free, what's the incentive to contribute to the economy?

Studies from Finland and Kenya show that people who received basic income were actually more likely to start small businesses or invest in education. It's not about laziness — it's about security.

Sure, but who pays for it? Won’t taxes go through the roof to fund this?

That’s a valid concern. Some economists propose replacing multiple existing welfare programs with a UBI to streamline costs and reduce administrative overhead.

What happens in a recession? If the government can’t raise enough money, do people just stop receiving their income?

That would depend on how it's structured, but ideally, it would be funded in a counter-cyclical way — through progressive taxes and automatic stabilizers, similar to how unemployment insurance works now.
